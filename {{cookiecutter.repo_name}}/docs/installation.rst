Installation

Stable release
--------------

Using pip
+++++++++

Python comes with an inbuilt package management system, `pip`_. Pip can install, update, or delete any official package.

To install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} using pip, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/stefmdavis/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}.git@latest

This will always install the latest version of `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}` provided you have `SSH set up on GitHub`_.

To activate the environment (assuming you are using one), run this command from the root directory of the repo::

    $ source env/bin/activate

And to deactivate the environment::

    $ deactivate

If you don't have pip installed, these `Python installation guides`_ can guide you through the process depending on your operating system and which python version you need.

Using pipenv
++++++++++++

Pipenv is a tool that automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects so that you no longer need to use pip and `virtualenv`_ separately.
It will add/remove packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages, and generate the ever-important Pipfile.lock which is used to produce deterministic builds.

If you're using **pipenv** for your virtual environment and you'd like to install from the repo, the command becomes (notice the ``#egg={{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}`` section)::

    $ pipenv install git+ssh://git@github.com/stefmdavis/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}.git@latest#egg={{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}

To activate the environment, the command is::

    $ pipenv shell

You should see ``({{ cookiecutter.repo_name }})`` at the start of the prompt now.  This indicates you are in the activated environment.  If you don't see it - something has gone wrong.

To deactivate the environment again, simply run::

    $ exit

.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

From sources
------------

You can build any of the packages from source. Those involved in development may take this route to get developmental versions or alter source code.

The sources for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} can be downloaded from the:

    * `Github repo`_

.. _Github repo: https://github.com/stefmdavis/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}

GitHub
++++++

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/stefmdavis/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}

Or download the `tarball`_ of the latest release:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/stefmdavis/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/tarball/latest

The same can be done for any version by simply replacing ``latest`` by the version tag you wish to download.

.. _tarball: https://github.com/stefmdavis/{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/tarball/latest
